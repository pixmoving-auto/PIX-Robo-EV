## ü§ó Welcome to the NEV project repository! 

- **Project Overviewüöó**
  The NEV project encompasses a suite of three vehicle models: `NEV Lite`, `NEV`, and the `Supercar`. Our initiative strives to offer a diverse array of electric vehicle options, catering to the varied needs and preferences of consumers.
- **Procect Visionsüåü**
  The NEV project launched with a clear vision and has since achieved several key milestones, including XXX. We are looking forward to a significant pre-sale event, scheduled for a future date, marking another step in our phased development plan.
- **Repository Purposeüõ†Ô∏è**
  This GitHub repository is  designed to serve as a dynamic platform for both users and engineers. It provides real-time updates on the latest project developments and engineering insights. Additionally, it extends an open invitation to all passionate geek designers and engineers to contribute to the project. Fork the repository, collaborate with us, and help drive innovation in the NEV project.
